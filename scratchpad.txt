There needs to be simple interface for communicating with printers

printer.js
    |> device.js
        |> serial.js
        |> ip_printer.js


A known device is a device that responds to G-Code

Known devices have all of their properties (model name, capabilities, etc) set

Unknown devices do not have these properties (obviously)

Communicating to a printer:
    addScriptToQueue(GCodeScript | string, Printer) -> void
    onOutputMatch(Regex, Printer) -> Promise<string>
    listPrinters() -> Array<Printer>
    refreshPrinterList() -> Promise<void>
    # All below might not be necessary
    startPrint(Printer) -> void
    stopPrint(Printer) -> void
    continuePrint(Printer) -> void
    pausePrint(Printer) -> void

sendGCodeScript(gscript, printer);
await onOutputMatch(/regex/, printer);

Send a G-Code command and then attach a promises' resolve and reject 

This way operations can be done synchronously
    Done

Open port - \/
    Wait for open event to occur, then send some
    test commands to see if the printer is responsive

Continue, Start, Pause, Stop

async func
    anonymous async func
        while loop
    after async function creation terminate
