All REST APIs will be on /api/v1 url

The frontend can see all of the serial devices that the server can see

The frontend will request to see all of the serial devices.
This request will return the device's:

GET /printer/get_known_printers
{
    connectionType (Serial, Network),
    serialPort,
    ipAddress,
    ipPort,
    Printer Compatibility table (?),
    Printer Model,
    PrinterState
    ...
}

Issue is the speed of getting the printerstate and model name

Listing serial ports is probably quick, but actually communicating
with them is probably slow 

Therefore, if we want the client to get a quick response after requesting
all connected devices, we have to have an array of connected devices that 
just gets returned

Therefore, there would be another service populating this array of devices
The model will simply format in a way that the controller wants
This way, the controller can be simple
